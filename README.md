# Arduino-Interface

I created this project to analyse the data from my robot. This application can:
 - make a connection (selecting a serial port alway's with a baudrate of 115200, standard for bluetooth)
 - plot data in a chart
 - enable and visualise the position of a joystick
 - change PID values on the robot
 - store PID values to the robot
 - save the data from the chart to a txt file
 
 This program needs to work closely together with the arduino program, wich I'll post here as well.
 
 If you have any questions feel free to reach out.

Here's a video of the application: http://youtu.be/aRB7GQL-qaU
